# GoFaster
A simple PowerShell module I use to speed up routine go commands.

## Use
Clone the repo into a folder referenced by $env:PSModulePath. Once the .psm1 file is present the module will load automatically the next time a PS shell is opened.  
Example target directory: *$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\GoFaster\*
