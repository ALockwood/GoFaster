# GoFaster
A simple PowerShell module I use to speed up routine go commands.

## Use
Clone the repo into a folder referenced by $env:PSModulePath. Ex: *$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\GitQuick\*  
Once the .psm1 file is present, the next time a PS shell is opened the module will load automatically.
